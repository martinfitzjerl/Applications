# Applications
Don't forget the basics! I elaborate on the 3 pillars of object oriented programming; Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Inheritance.
There are tons of ways to build your applications, in each of my applications I am sure to use new concepts I learn such as using Dictionary objects to store both integer and string types as key value pairs. As well as using Structs as they are Value Type classes that can hold several variables.
