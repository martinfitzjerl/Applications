-----Info-----
Wishes features all ASCII art hand-crafted by me, it took me hours to craft the art I used in Wishes. 
It takes patience and mental focus to put each part of the art together. 
I have by no means perfected the art form but I have definitely found admiration 
for it. If my art has given you an interest in ASCII art or you want to rediscover 
the art form I have provided a few resources to get started:

-----Store For The Mind-----
One of the things that inspired me to develop Wishes was the driving force to 
understand the mind, karma, and choices! I know you too have made choices in 
your life that have defined the way you think about life and your purpose 
in it and so have I. I have found myself discovering several different techniques, 
theories, and books. I have taken the initiative to support 
several products that I truly have reaped benefits from on a daily basis. 
Knowing that how to formulate myself mentally is the strongest possession I 
have is the key to my successes; and I know you are able to develop and strengthen the same belief.
