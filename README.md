# Applications
Don't forget the basics! I elaborate on the 3 pillars of object oriented programming; Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Inheritance.
There are tons of ways to build your applications, in each of my applications I am sure to use new concepts such as Dictionary objects to store several key value pairs and Structs as they are Value Type classes that can hold several variables.
